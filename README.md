## <a id="why_hazard"></a>🔎 〢 Why choose Hazard v2?

You might be wondering, Why choose this grabber instead of other ones like [Mercurial](https://github.com/NightfallGT/Mercurial-Grabber) or [ItroublveTSC](https://github.com/Itroublve/ItroublveTSC). Without making this a competition Hazard v2 has many advantages over alot of grabbers out there, popular, free and even paid ones. V2 is well maintained and updates gets pushed out on a regular basis making it a non-buggy, clean, and working grabber. V2 was for example the first grabber to bypass and decrypt discords new token encryption and additionally has a [injection](https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection) which also currently is the only working one.

Here are some pros and cons why/why not use Hazard v2 instead of other ones

### ✔ Pros

⁃ Extremely well maintained, making it a safe choice \
⁃ Partly undetected just because it gets updates often \
⁃ Easy to use and setup \
⁃ Completely free and open source \
⁃ Loads of wide spread features not only focused on discord \
⁃ Cleans itself up, deleting all traces of itself which suprisingly most others don't \
⁃ Supports a webhook protector I made ([Discord-Webhook-Protector](https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector)) making it impossible to delete your webhook \
⁃ Even thought it's made in python it's very fast thanks to async and threading \
⁃ Clean embed & isn't spammy like others making it less likely to get ratelimited \
⁃ Takes feedback and listens to what people want to be added/changed/removed

### ❌ Cons

⁃ Made in Python making it lose to other grabbers in terms of speed \
⁃ Python is an interpreted language, it needs to pack the engine & all dependencies making the file size very big \
⁃ Only supports windows 10/11 \
⁃ Can be pretty easily decompiled (still harder than Mercurial atleast)

In the end it's just up to **you** to choose what grabber suits you and your needs the best.

## <a id="enhancements"></a>🌟 〢 todo/enhancements

~~overlined~~ = on hold/not adding

- Self spread | Suggestion from [FuckingToasters](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/issues/31)
- Grab Wifi passwords | Suggestion from [msr8](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/issues/35)
- ~~Metamask Priv Key and seed | Suggestion from [Snipeeeey](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/issues/281)~~
- Grab Minecraft accessToken | Suggestion from [p3tt3](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/issues/248)
- Better Anti-vm/Anti-debug (check screen size?, more registery checks?, make the lists outbound?)
- Exe builder (clean gui, toggable options, compress exe (file size <= 8mb), etc...)

---

## <a id="premium"></a>💎 〢 Premium

Hazard v2 is a free software. It will **NOT** be undetected from antiviruses, or have custom features such as:

- Stealing from more browsers (edge, firefox, brave, opera etc..)
- Stealing creditcards, addresses, emails, phone numbers, names etc..
- Crypto/Wallet stealing
- Undetected from antivirus
- Obfuscated to a irreversible point
- Made in a compiled language (stealers made in python automatically becomes bad)
- Multi os support
- Loads more

Currently the premium grabber is not out yet, but the goal is that the premium one will be a cheap but powerfull grabber and will have the features listed above 10x.
join [cheataway](https://cheataway.com/invite) and do `!buy` to see preview of the grabber, free trial will be available so you can try it out and see if you like it.
